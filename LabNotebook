Creation of Lab notebook to note what I've been up to an project status.
I've been sourcing water tanks and hydraulic couplings but it was a pain. Hopefully I found something nice couplings
and I'll create my own custom tank. I think I'll slide the water tank with 2 couplings which are selflocking
I'll implemnet a push button to release them and free the water tank for refill
