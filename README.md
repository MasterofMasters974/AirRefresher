SUM UP :

The goal is to ensure a temperature drop of 3 degrees below the indoor temperature locally,
using the minimum amount of water in the longest period of time.

TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES :

  - Maintain 3 degree below indoor temperature locally
  - Maintain the temperature drop for at least 30 minutes
  - Use the least amont of water, with max allowed : 1L
  - Maintain the -3Â°C within at least 50cm

DESCRIPTION :

The project work with a closed loop water circuit which is pumped via a peristalic pump. A
fan makes air flow through an exchanger so the fresh water cools down the air. The water
is gaining heat and then needs to be replaced with fresh water again after 30 minutes.
An HMI will indicate the remaining time until purge with temperature sensors
